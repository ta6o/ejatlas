%p The website of EJATLAS and our inventories and maps of environmental conflicts are supported by the  ENVJUST project (European Research Council Advanced Grant 2016-2021), directed by Joan Martinez-Alier and the ACKnowl-EJ (Academic-Activist Co-Production of Knowledge for Environmental Justice, 2015-2018) directed by Leah Temper and Ashish Kothari and funded by the Transformations to Sustainability Programme, which is coordinated by the International Social Science Council and funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), and implemented in partnership with the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number TKN150317115354). The Transformations to Sustainability Programme represents a contribution to Future Earth. Both projects are coordinated from the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA) at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.
